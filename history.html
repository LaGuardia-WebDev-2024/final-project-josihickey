      I love all things history, but my favorite topics are ancient government, politics, and political theory; Revolutionary-era America; the Cold War, especially the Vietnam War and Pentagon Papers; and dance history. Currently, I am most interested in doing research on the intersection of dance and politics historically, as well as continuing research on the Pentagon Papers and what they illustrate about how the Government utilizes excessive power and democratic methods of combating this.
