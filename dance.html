 These are some of my family's recipies! Because of this, a lot of the instructions are not 
  very specific, but are more along the lines of how I learned how to make, and how they
  have been passed down through my family. If you end up making any of them, I might be able 
  to give more specific instructions/ingredients!

  <h2 id="rolls">Nanny's Giuggiuleni Rolls</h2>
  <p>
    These are my Nanny's (my great-grandmother) rolls! I think I'd give nearly anything to have one again. 
    She used to make them for a Sunday night dinner. It was always very special when she made them.They 
    were the absolute best. I wrote this down using the recipe on the index card she wrote, but it's not very 
    specific, and there's no instructions, so I put it together where I could. I've only made them once, so bare 
    with me. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Time: About 1.5 hours</li>
    <li>Serves: Probably 12</li>

  <p><strong>Instructions</strong>
  <br><br>I will say that the ingredients list written by my Nanny and the ingredient 
    quantity in the steps are slightly different, but I'm using my Nanny's index card. 
    I will say to go a bot heavier on the salt than she did though. The written 
    instructions say something more along the ines of one heaping tbs.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix flour, instant yeast (1 packet), and 1 (heaping) tbs salt</li>
    <li>Add crisco and hot water until soft, sticky, and a little wet. Knead for 10 min.</li>
    <li>Let rise for 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Grease baking sheet or pan.</li>
    <li>Shape rolls on floured surface; put on sheet. Cover with a towel and let rise for an hour.</li>
    <li>Beat one egg and brush on top. Sprinle giuggiuleni (sesame seeds) on top.</li>
    <li>Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.</li>

  <p>
    Another one of my Nanny's recipies! Unless it was her mother's, I'm not sure. It's essentially a Sicilian-American 
    Sunday sauce slowly cooked with meat in it. My mom (or maybe my Nana) used to tell me that Nanny would start making 
    it early Sunday morning, go to church, let it cook all day, and then they would have dinner around 4. While it does 
    take all day, I promise it is so worth it! I'm also vegetarian, so I usually use other protien  options instead of 
    the meat, so if you do that just add less sugar.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Time: All day, but in a low energy way. Making the sauce doesn't take too long.</li>
    <li>Serves: You'll be eating it the rest of the week!</li>

    italian seasoning to taste.</li>

  <h2 id="lemon">Lemon and Parmesan Pasta</h2>
  <p>
    This is a recipe of my own, adapted from the cookbook <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.chefbentish.com/books-and-writing">Sicilia</a></em> by Ben Tish. 
    It makes for a great late night meal, and is pretty easy to throw together. It's essentially my quicker version for when I don't have the energy to cook. By the way, you can totally make it with leftover pasta, I do all the time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Time:It's a race. Maybe 10-15, not counting the time it takes to cook the pasta.</li>
    <li>Serves: As much as you want.</li>

    This is a fabulous meal if you are feeling a bit under the weather, or just want something nice

  <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Chop the celery and onion (and the garlic if you're using fresh garlic. I never do). Dice the onion and cut the celery in the normal way to cut it.</li>
    <li>In a medium sized pot, melt a bit of butter, and throw in the garlic. Cook that for a tiny bit, and then add the celery and onion. Cook until it looks good (you don't need to fully cook it because it will cook in the broth). </li>
    <li>Add two cups of water to the pot, and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>When the water boils, stir in the buillon. If you just used broth to start out with, skip this step.</li>
    <li>Add in the pastina. Bring down the heat a bit, and cover</li>
    <li>Cook the pastina until the liquid has been largely absorbed, about 6-8 minutes. Stir when you remember to.</li>
    <li>Remove the pot from heat. Stir in parmesan, and any additional butter or olive oil you wanted to add. Then, season to taste.</li>
    <li>Serve in a bowl, and add a little parmesan on top! Enjoy!</li>
